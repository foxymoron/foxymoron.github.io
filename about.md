I just started my fourth semester of Masters in Computer Science. My primary
area of interest are machine learning and distributed systems. I'm also a
hackathon junkie, travelling far and wide to get my fix. You can find what I've
been upto on my [team page][teampage].

You can reach me via [email][email] or [twitter][twitter].
